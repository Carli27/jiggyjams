import { useEffect, useState } from "react"; // this  isn't working
import App from "../App"; // is this correct

// can't pass a prop that doesn't exist - only in the brackets () not the body of the function
function Homepage() {
  // useEffect(() => {
  //   allJams();
  // }, []);

  return <div></div>;
}

export default Homepage; // always have to export the file
